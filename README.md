# The National Journal Countdown Clock
An embeddable countdown clock that accepts a title and an end date/time as parameters. 

Download and launch your very own countdown clock business, or see our hosted version [here](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/nationaljournal/countdown/make/index.html).

## Getting started
### Install through GitHub
1. Download and unzip the [source files](https://github.com/arm5077/countdown-clock/archive/master.zip).
2. Either:
  - Open `make/index.html` in your web browser, or
  - Navigate to the target folder, open your command line/terminal and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. Then open your web browser and go to <http://localhost:8000/make/>.

### Make a countdown
1. Write a title, using `<strong>` tags to emphasize text.
2. Choose your end date and time (it's hardcoded to EST for now, so adjust accordingly if you're in a different timezone). 
3. Copy the embed code and drop into the CMS/web page of your choice.
